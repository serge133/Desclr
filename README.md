# Desclr

A habit tracking app

## Make sure to logout when unhandled rejection

## Successes

- Trends
- Timer
- Authentication and users

## Focus

- [ ] Add Shorter intervals
- [x] Titles on some screens are overflowing
- [ ] Notifications

## Errors

- [x] The trends screen is **Not Fully Functional** because habits that do not include a timer won't work in the minutes passed section in the trends screen. This needs to be fixed for habits that don't have a timer to not include the minutes passed section in the trends screen.
- [x] Database does not record empty array of minutes passed in the trends key in the habit interface. This causes _undefined_ to break the app
